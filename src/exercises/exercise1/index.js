📚 Exercise 1 - Making a Stateless Component Stateful 📚
 
  Welcome to Exercise 1! In your browser, make 
  sure "Exercise 1" is bold in the browser 
  navigation before proceeding. 

  We are working with a form that does not 
  manage its own state; the inputs in the 
  form take input, but they don't currently
  send it anywhere. This exercise will make 
  this form stateful, and validate its fields!

  🛠️ Open 'part1.js' in this folder when you're 
  🛠️ ready to start!
